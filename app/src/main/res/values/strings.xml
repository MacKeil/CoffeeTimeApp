    <string name="DripInfo">The drip method is by far the simplest. You need to grind the coffee
    into a fine powder. You need to boil the water, but as with all forms of coffee you should make
    sure that the water is at 195 F (91 C). You will need to take the kettle off the heat for roughly
    25 seconds to get this temperature. Use the timer below to cool the water.</string>
